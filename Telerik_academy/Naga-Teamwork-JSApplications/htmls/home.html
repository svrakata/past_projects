            It’s finally here—the comprehensive, authoritative book that does for beer what The Wine Bible does for wine. Written by an expert from the West Coast, where America’s craft beer movement got its start, The Beer Bible is the ultimate reader- and drinker-friendly guide to all the world’s beers.

            No other book of this depth and scope approaches the subject of beer in the same way that beer lovers do—by style, just as a perfect pub menu is organized—and gets right to the pleasure of discovery, knowledge, and connoisseurship. Divided into four major families—ales, lagers, wheat beers, and tart and wild ales—there’s everything a beer drinker wants to know about the hundreds of different authentic types of brews, from bitters, bocks, and IPAs to weisses, milk stouts, lambics, and more. Each style is a chapter unto itself, delving into origins, ingredients, description and characteristics, substyles, and tasting notes, and ending with a recommended list of the beers to know in each category. Hip infographics throughout make the explanation of beer’s flavors, brewing methods, ingredients, labeling, serving, and more as immediate as it is lively.

            The book is written for passionate beginners, who will love its “if you like X, try Y” feature; for intermediate beer lovers eager to go deeper; and for true geeks, who will find new information on every page. History, romance, the art of tasting, backstories and anecdotes, appropriate glassware, bitterness units, mouthfeel, and more—it’s all here. Plus a primer on pairing beer and food using the three Cs— complement, contrast, or cut. It’s the book that every beer lover will read with pleasure, and use with even more.
            This is the most comprehensive book about beer I've ever seen. Over 600 pages, packed with anything and everything you ever wanted to know about beer. You can tell the author, Jeff Alworth, definitely did some extensive and exhaustive research on the content. The first part of the book gives a general history of beer, including early varieties and breweries, all the way up to commercial and craft breweries. There are tips on experiencing and appreciating your beer, how to read a label, and understanding the components of different styles and varieties. There is also a section on how beer is brewed, what makes it taste good (or better), and different things that might happen to make it taste bad.

            Part Two through Part Five is dedicated to the different types of beer that exist: Ales, Wheat Beers, Lagers, and Tart and Wild Ales. Each type is further broken down into different varieties, taking you through common and traditional styles, as well as lesser-known and emerging styles. You'll learn the origin of each type, characteristics, varieties, brewing notes, and evolution. Each type of beer also has a "Beers to Know" section that lists popular beers, including where to find them and what they are composed of (ABV, IBU, type of hops, malts, other flavors, etc.).

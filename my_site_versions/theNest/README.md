### Html structure rules and remarks:

* **Nav nested in the header is not a requirement:** Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)

    >Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than a individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.

* **Semantics are suppored back to IE9:** Source: [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#search=semantic)
* **Viewport units: vh, vw etc. are suported back to IE11:** [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#search=vh)
